                Markangelo, the owner and primary instructor at Lovitt&apos;s Jiu Jitsu, has dedicated over 12 years to the art of jiu jitsu and the pursuit of mastery. A brown belt on the path to black, his journey is fueled by a deep passion for the sport and its transformative power. For Markangelo, jiu jitsu is more than techniqueâ€”it is a forge where integrity and self-control are shaped. Through his teachings, he seeks to inspire both young and old to carry these virtues beyond the mat, into every corner of their lives.
